# 🔧 Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Theme Changes Immediately
**Problem:** Theme only changed after saving, closing, and reopening profile.
**Solution:** Added `st.rerun()` immediately after saving theme preferences to apply changes instantly.

**Code Change in `profile_manager.py`:**
```python
if st.button("💾 Save Preferences", type="primary"):
    if auth.update_theme_preference(st.session_state.username, theme_option):
        st.session_state.theme = theme_option
        st.success("✅ Preferences saved successfully!")
        st.rerun()  # Immediately apply theme changes
    else:
        st.error("Failed to save preferences. Please try again.")
```

### 2. ✅ Dark Theme Text Visibility Fixed
**Problem:** Some text remained dark and invisible in dark theme.
**Solution:** Enhanced CSS with comprehensive dark theme styling for all Streamlit components.

**Code Changes in `app.py`:**
- Added extensive CSS rules for dark theme
- Covered all text elements, inputs, labels, and containers
- Ensured proper contrast for readability
- Fixed sidebar text visibility
- Made metrics and expanders dark-theme compatible

**Key CSS additions:**
```css
.stMarkdown, .stMarkdown p, .stMarkdown h1, h2, h3, h4 {
    color: #ffffff !important;
}
.stSidebar .stMarkdown, .stSidebar .stMarkdown p {
    color: #ffffff !important;
}
.stSidebar .stSelectbox label, .stSidebar .stSlider label {
    color: #ffffff !important;
}
```

### 3. ✅ Reduced Emoji Usage
**Problem:** Overuse of emojis throughout the application.
**Solution:** Kept emojis only in important places, mainly the profile area.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed emojis from most buttons and labels
- Kept movie emoji (🎬) in main title
- Maintained profile-related emojis (👤, 🔒, ⚙️)
